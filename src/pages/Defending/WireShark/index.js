            <Divider />
            <p>
            Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer which is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, 
            software and communications protocol development, and education. Wireshark is cross-platform, being able
            to run on Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, some other Unix-like operating systems, and Microsoft Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
            Wireshark has a graphical front-end and integrated sorting and filtering options.
            Wireshark lets the user put network interface controllers into promiscuous mode 
            so they can see all the traffic visible on that interface including unicast traffic not sent to that 
            network interface controller's MAC address. However, when capturing with a packet analyzer in promiscuous mode on 
            a port on a network switch, not all traffic through the switch is necessarily sent to the port where the capture 
            is done, so capturing in promiscuous mode is not necessarily sufficient to see all network traffic. Port mirroring 
            or various network taps extend capture to any point on the network. Simple passive taps are extremely resistant to tampering.
