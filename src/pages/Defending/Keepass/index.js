            <Divider />
            <p>
            KeePass Password Safe is a free and open-source password manager primarily designed for Windows. 
            It officially supports macOS and Linux operating systems however it has several unofficial 
            ports for Windows Phone, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices. KeePass's main functionality 
            is to store usernames, passwords, and other fields, in an encrypted file. This file is 
            protected by any combination of a master password, a key file, and the current Windows 
            account details. By default, the KeePass database is stored on a local file system 
            and the databases are encrypted using the best and current most secure encryption algorithms 
            currently known, AES and Twofish.

            In addition, KeePass supports a number of plugins. These include a password generator and 
            synchronization function, supports two-factor authentication, and has a Secure Desktop mode. 
            Also, it can provide protection against keyloggers, using a two-channel auto-type obfuscation 
            feature.

            <h2>Cryptography</h2>
            <Divider />
            <h3>Runtime security</h3>
            <p>
            KeePass is able to use security-enhanced password edit controls, which is known as CSecureEditEx. Passwords 
            are protected in memory while KeePass is running. On Windows Vista and later versions, passwords are 
            encrypted in process memory using Windows Data Protection API, which stores the key for memory 
            protection in a secure, non-swappable memory area. While on previous Windows systems, KeePass uses the ARC4 
            cipher with a temporary, random session key.
            </p>
            <h3>Offline security</h3>
            <p>
            To access the database, a master password or a key file is required or combination. Both methods may be combined to create a 
            "composite master key". If the combination is used, then both must be present to access the password database. In the latest 
            version, KeePass now has a third optionâ€”dependency upon the current Windows user. The database encryption is done through AES
            , Twofish or ChaCha20 symmetric cipher, where the first two are used in CBC/PKCS7 mode. AES is the default option while the 
            rest are only available in specific versions.
